# Provenance

A common architecture used for data collection.

Provenance collects and stores articles from [infoq.com](https://www.infoq.com/) and follows a
Netflix [Conductor-esque](https://netflix.github.io/conductor/) architecture.

### History

In 2016 we began a project to address some of the concerns around fake news. While most were analyzing articles, we
decided to take another approach; showing consumers where their content comes from. Our goal was to bring
source [journalist] context to the foreground.

### The exercise

Get the tests to pass!

- Query the articles gateway.
- Map rss results to a collection.
- Start the background worker.

Look for todo items in the codebase for where to get started.

### Quick start

Download the codebase.

Create a jar file without running tests.

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

### Articles

Run the articles component tests to see what's failing.

```bash
./gradlew :components:articles:test
```

Review the *todo* comments in the `ArticlesController` class and get the tests to pass. Along the way it will be helpful
to use the `writeJsonBody` method to convert articles to json.

```java
writeJsonBody(servletResponse, articles);
```

### Endpoints

Run the endpoints component tests to see what's failing.

```bash
./gradlew :components:endpoints:test  
```

Review the *todo* comments in the EndpointWorker class and get the tests to pass. Along the way it will be helpful to
use `XmlMapper` to convert RSS feeds to Java objects.

```java
RSS rss = new XmlMapper().readValue(response, RSS.class);
```

### Test suite

Ensure all the tests pass.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Schedule work

Review *todo* comments in the `App` class within the provenance-server component. Create and start a `WorkScheduler`.

```java
WorkScheduler<EndpointTask> scheduler = new WorkScheduler<>(finder, workers, 300);
``` 

_Pro tip:_ review the `testScheduler` test in the `WorkSchedulerTest` class.

### Run locally

Build the application again then run it locally to ensure that the endpoint worker is collecting articles.

```bash
./gradlew build
java -jar applications/provenance-server/build/libs/provenance-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Make a request for all articles in another terminal window.

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8881/articles
powershell: iwr http://localhost:8881/articles -Headers @{Accept='application/json'}
```

## Run with Docker

1. Build with Docker.
   ```bash
    docker build -t provenance-server . --platform linux/amd64
    powershell: docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t provenance-server .
    ```

1. Run with Docker.
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8881:8881 provenance-server
   ```

Hope you enjoy the exercise!

## Takeaways 
1. Components interaction via interfaces and controllers
 - __Controllers__ (`ArticlesController`, `NoopController`) act as a bridge betwee HTTP requests and business logic.
 - __Data Gateways__ (`ArticleDataGateway`, `EndpointDataGateway`) provide interfaces for data access, abstracting away storage details.
 - __Workflow Components__ (`WorkScheduler`, `Worker`, `WorkFinder`) interact via interfaces to schedule and execute background tasks.
 
 2. Separation of business logic from infrastructure
 - __Business logic__ focuses on what the application does through `ArticleDataGateway`, `EndpointWorker`, and `WorkScheduler`.
 _ __Infrastructure__ focuses on how the application runs through `BasicApp` (web server) and `RestTemplate` (HTTP client) and Docker configuration

 3. Structure for scalability and maintainability
 - __Modulular directory structure__ `components/` for resuable business modules (articles, endpoints, RSS, worflow); and `applications/` for runnable apps.
 - __Loose coupling__ components interact via interfaces not concrete implementations.
 - __Resuability__ each component can be developed and tested independently.
 - __Extensibility__ new features (a new data source or workflow) can be added without disrupting existing code.

 4. RESTful API design and workflow management
 - __RESTful API design__ controllers expose endpoints (e.g. `/articles`) that follow REST principles: stateless, resource-oriented using HTTP methods, and uses JSON for data exchange (via Jackson).
 - __Workflow management__ background tasks are managed by `WorkScheduler`, `Worker` and `WorkFinder`. Tasks are discovered, scheduled, and executed independently of HTTP requests which allows for async processing.

 5. Docker for consistent deployment
 - __Dockerfile__ defined how to build and run the app in a container and ensures running in the same way everywhere.
 - __Procfile__ states the command to start the app.
 - __Environment variables__ port is read form the environment.
